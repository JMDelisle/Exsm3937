EXSM3937 SQL Fundamental Final Project


Making multiple data to pull from multiple tables. I have to watch out on how the table are being called. It is very interesting on how this project going. This is a brain teaser project but well worth it! Syntax was discussed with James and determined that there was an update.
->Error: Finding an error stating subquery returns more than 1 row. Trying to find solutions to it. Subquery works well on it own but when adding to START TRANSACTION - COMMIT, that dosesn't work at all.
->Determined that I cannot have the TRANSACTION at the top of the page and at the bottom of the page.  For which ever reason its conflicting with each other code source line-- 89 to 101. You'll see what I did from the commented codes.
